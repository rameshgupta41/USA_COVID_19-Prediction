# USA_COVID_19-Prediction
Corona Virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. In this repository, I analyze the current condition of COVID_19 in each state of the USA(United State of America) and predict the future condition of COVID_19 with different conditions.
